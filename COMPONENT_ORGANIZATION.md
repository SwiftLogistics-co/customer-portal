# Component Organization

This document describes the modular component structure implemented for driver and customer specific features.

## Structure

```
src/components/
├── customer/           # Customer-specific components
├── driver/            # Driver-specific components
└── ui/               # Shared UI components (existing)
```

## Customer Components (`src/components/customer/`)

### Dashboard Components
- **DashboardStats**: Statistics cards showing active deliveries, pending pickups, etc.
- **QuickTracker**: Component for quickly tracking orders by ID
- **RecentActivity**: List of recent order activities with icons and timestamps

### Order Management Components  
- **OrderFilters**: Search and filter controls for order lists
- **OrderTable**: Table displaying customer orders with pagination
- **OrderRow**: Individual row component for order table entries

### Form Components
- **AddressAutocomplete**: Autocomplete input for address fields with suggestions
- **PackageDetails**: Form section for package information (type, weight, dimensions, priority)

## Driver Components (`src/components/driver/`)

### Dashboard Components
- **DriverStats**: Statistics cards for assigned orders, completed deliveries, etc.
- **AssignedOrdersList**: List of orders assigned to the driver for the day
- **OrderStatusCard**: Individual order card with status, priority, and actions

### Order Management Components
- **DriverOrderFilters**: Search and filter controls for driver order views
- **DriverOrderTable**: Table displaying driver's assigned orders
- **DriverOrderRow**: Individual row component for driver order table

### Route Components
- **RouteOverview**: Route summary with distance, duration, and progress
- **RouteStopList**: List of all stops on the driver's route
- **RouteStopCard**: Individual stop card with address, time, and status

## Design Principles

### Appropriate Modularization
- Components are extracted based on **functional cohesion** - each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Reusability** - Components that appear in multiple places or could be reused are extracted
- **Domain separation** - Customer and driver components are clearly separated by domain context

### Avoiding Over-Modularization
- Simple UI elements that are unlikely to be reused remain inline
- Components maintain reasonable size and complexity
- Related functionality is kept together where it makes sense

### Code Clarity Benefits
1. **Clear domain boundaries** between customer and driver features
2. **Easier maintenance** - related components are co-located
3. **Better testing** - components can be tested in isolation
4. **Team productivity** - developers can work on customer or driver features independently
5. **Code reuse** - common patterns are extracted and shared

## Usage

Components can be imported individually:
```typescript
import { DashboardStats } from '@/components/customer/DashboardStats';
import { DriverStats } from '@/components/driver/DriverStats';
```

Or using the index files:
```typescript
import { DashboardStats, QuickTracker } from '@/components/customer';
import { DriverStats, RouteOverview } from '@/components/driver';
```

## Pages Updated

The following pages have been refactored to use the new component structure:

### Customer Pages
- `src/pages/customer/Dashboard.tsx` - Uses DashboardStats, QuickTracker, RecentActivity
- `src/pages/customer/MyOrders.tsx` - Uses OrderFilters, OrderTable
- `src/pages/customer/NewOrder.tsx` - Uses AddressAutocomplete, PackageDetails

### Driver Pages  
- `src/pages/driver/DriverDashboard.tsx` - Uses DriverStats, AssignedOrdersList
- `src/pages/driver/DriverOrders.tsx` - Uses DriverOrderFilters, DriverOrderTable
- `src/pages/driver/DriverRoute.tsx` - Uses RouteOverview, RouteStopList

This organization improves code maintainability while following React best practices for component composition.
